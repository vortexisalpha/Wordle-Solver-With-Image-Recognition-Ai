# Wordle-Solver

This is another method I used to automate the process of playing the game wordle. This was used by using colour detection libraries and taking screenshots of the web page. This was before I learned how to bypass the shaddow roots on the website.
This does not use any web scraping and instead uses the screen hence it is undetectable by a browser!
